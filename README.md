## What use can you make of my to-do-list ?

1. You'll be able to use the project in French, in English and in Italian.
2. You'll then be able to create a task and :
..* Display it,
..* Edit it (changing the content of the task as well as changing the importance),
..* Give it an importance (such as 'important', 'very important', 'negligible'...),
..* Mark it as done,
..* Put the task on pause and resume it if needed,
..* Delete a task as well as clearing all tasks,
..* Obviously, all the tasks, their content, state, importance etc. are stored in your computer's local storage.
3. You'll have the choice between night mode or day mode, which will be stored in your local storage as well so that you have your own preerences stored.
4. A random pokemon will give you its strength by staying at the top of the page, and it will change everytime you reload the page/open the project.
5.

> The to-do-list is free of use for everybody for a personal use, i enjoyed doing it and i hope people will enjoy using it and will send me feedback to try and make something great out of such a simple web project.
> I will now tell you what you need to do to run this project :

# First of all, you'll need to download the angular cli by doing `npm install -g @angular/cli`
# Then you'll need to pull the project and go into it by doing a `git pull <projectHttp/projectSSH>`
# Then, go to the directory by doing `cd <pathToProject>`
# and to finish, launch the project with `ng serve -o`
